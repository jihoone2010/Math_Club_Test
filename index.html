    <div class="intro"><p>NYM, or New Vies of Mathmatics, is a school organization that aims to promote "unconventional" math topics, thereby offering new views and perspectives of math
        that are not covered in the spectrum of school math topics. Students are asked to research into a particular math topic, and then to sumarize the research and offer us with new information and new perspectives. After the
        research is done, students can work on a project, which includes making serious games, articles, or problems.
